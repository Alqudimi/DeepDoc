## üíª Code Contributions (Pull Requests)

We follow the standard GitHub flow for code contributions.

### Getting Started

1.  **Fork** the [DeepDoc repository](https://github.com/Alqudimi/DeepDoc).
2.  **Clone** your forked repository locally:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DeepDoc.git
    cd DeepDoc
    ```
3.  **Install in Editable Mode** with development dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .[dev]
    ```
    *(Note: Assuming a `[dev]` extra is defined in `pyproject.toml` for testing/linting tools.)*
4.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-awesome-feature
    # or
    git checkout -b bugfix/issue-number
    ```

### Making Changes

*   **Follow the Code Style:** DeepDoc uses standard Python conventions (PEP 8). We recommend using a linter like `flake8` or `black`.
*   **Write Tests:** All new features or bug fixes must be accompanied by relevant unit or integration tests in the `tests/` directory.
*   **Run Tests:** Ensure all existing tests pass before committing:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

### Submitting the Pull Request (PR)

1.  **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add support for new Ollama model parameter"
    ```
2.  **Push your branch** to your fork:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-awesome-feature
    ```
3.  **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch of the original [Alqudimi/DeepDoc](https://github.com/Alqudimi/DeepDoc) repository.
4.  **Fill out the PR template** completely, describing your changes and linking to any relevant issues.

## üìù Documentation Contributions

DeepDoc is about documentation, so we take it seriously! If you find an error, a typo, or a section that could be clearer in the `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `USAGE.md`, or any other documentation file:

*   Submit a Pull Request with your suggested changes.
*   Ensure your changes are clear, concise, and grammatically correct.

Thank you for helping to make DeepDoc a better tool for the community!
